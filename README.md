# Input-Validation-Library
This is an object-oriented input validation library for C++. It provides a set of functions to handle, manipulate and validate various types of inputs, including numbers, dates, strings and characters.  

## Features
1. Validates number inputs with functions like bool IsNumberBetween(short Num, short From, short To)  
2. Validates date inputs with functions like bool IsDateBetween(clsDate Date, clsDate Date1, clsDate Date2) and bool IsValidDate(clsDate Date)
3. Reads integer inputs with functions like int ReadIntNumber() and int ReadIntNumberBetween(int From, int To)
4. Reads double and float inputs with functions like double ReadDblNumber() and float ReadFloatNumber()
5. Reads string and character inputs with functions like string ReadString() and char ReadCharacter()
